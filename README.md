# Project Report: Design and Development of a Motorized Assistive Cart

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the systematic design, development, and implementation of a motorized assistive cart project. The objective was to create a compact and user-friendly device capable of assisting individuals with moderate loads while navigating inclines and uneven surfaces. The system integrates mechanical, electrical, and control engineering principles, focusing on efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

## 2. Project Objectives

* Develop a motorized cart powered by a 24V, 400W brushless DC motor.
* Ensure smooth speed control, reliable torque output, and user safety.
* Design a complete electronic system including battery management, motor control, and user interface.
* Implement a functional schematic and Bill of Materials (BoM).

## 3. Requirements Analysis

* **Load Capacity:** Up to 80 kg
* **Speed:** Target range of 4â€“6 km/h

## 9. Risk Analysis

A Design-FMEA (D-FMEA) was conducted, identifying key risks such as motor overload, power loss, and user error. Mitigating measures were implemented via hardware protection and control logic redundancies.

## 10. Testing and Validation

* Simulated full load operation and speed variation
* Verified PWM response to throttle input
* Confirmed protection circuit responses (fuse, diode clamping)
* Measured voltage drop across shunt resistors for current sensing

## 11. Challenges
